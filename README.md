# LetMeWatch DAMMIT

My project here is a quick roundabout to watch youtube videos, since their ad-crackdown is annoying.

You're able to select a youtube link, short or embedded link and then paste it ito the text-input that will then be quickly analyzed and trimmed to fit the embedded version.

This will allow the user to then watch their desires youtube video, unless it's: age-restricted, disables by the content creator.

This project might develop further with more supported websites.

You can check out how it would look and act here, since I don't have a domain for this: https://letmewatch-dammit.000webhostapp.com/
