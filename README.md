# LetMeWatch DAMMIT

My project here is a quick roundabout to watch youtube videos, since their ad-crackdown is annoying.

You're able to select a media links, and then paste it ito the text-input that will then be quickly analyzed and trimmed to fit the embedded version.

This will allow the user to then watch their desired youtube video, unless it's: age-restricted, disabled by the content creator.

This project might develop further with more supported websites.

Supported websites:
Youtube.

You can check out how it would look and act here, since I don't have a domain for this: https://ljkiller.github.io/LetMeWatch/
